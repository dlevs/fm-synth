## Dependencies

### Webpack

Webpack is only installed to keep react-scripts happy as the version installed as a dependency of storybook supposedly interfered with react-scripts. See this issue:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1795

The webpack version should match the one demanded by the preflight check error message.
