## Getting started

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run in the root of this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

See [package.json](./package.json) for all available commands.

## Dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with:

- [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for the main app compilation. It has a single devDependency: `react-scripts`.
- [`@storybook/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/cli) for showcasing and testing the component library in isolation. It has a few dependencies prefixed with `@storybook` (like `@storybook/addon-info`), and two non-prefixed dependencies: `@babel/core` and `babel-loader`.

### `react-scripts` preflight checks

`react-scripts` throws an error when it detects that one of its dependencies has been installed manually. See this issue:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1795

Due to this, `webpack` is installed as a devDependency in package.json, even though it is not used explicitly in this project. `react-scripts` doesn't like the version of `webpack` used by storybook, so we manually install the one it wants.
